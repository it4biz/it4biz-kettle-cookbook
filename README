kettle-cookbook
===============
Kettle-Cookbook is an auto-documentation tool for Kettle, a.k.a. 
Pentaho Data Integration (http://kettle.pentaho.com/).
It generates human readable documentation in HTML format for 
collections of Kettle .ktr / .kjb files. 

Kettle-cookbook is open source (LGPL), and is available from 
google code: http://code.google.com/p/kettle-cookbook/

Kettle-cookbook is itself built as a Kettle solution. 
To use kettle-cookbook, you have to run the pdi/document-folder.kjb kettle
job located in the pdi directory. The job accepts 3 parameters:

INPUT_DIR: the directory containing the .ktr/.kjb files
OUTPUT_DIR: the directory where the generated documentation will be stored.
SAXON: the path to the location of the saxon jar used to process the xslt

This can also process repository based ETLs. It requires that the repository
be filesystem based. If you have an Enterprise repository you can export it
the import it into a local filesystem based repository.

You can run the pdi/document-folder.kjb from the kettle IDE spoon, or run
it from the command line using the kitchen tool. For more detailed
instructions, see the wiki pages on the google code project:
